# Abstract

The session will provide a guided, hands-on introduction to the Cisco Python API on IOS XE.  The Python scripting 
capabilities of IOS XE gives network engineers programmatic access to the network device's CLI for device management 
and configuration, Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), and Embedded Event Manager (EEM) actions.  Using the Python modules 
packaged with Guest Shell, participants will learn how to leverage on-box network programmability effectively.  At 
the end of the session, participants will have completed a number of example hands-on exercises demonstrating real 
world use cases.
