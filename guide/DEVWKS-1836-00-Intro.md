# Introduction

The title of this workshop is "Hands-On with Cisco Python API on IOS XE".  In this workshop , we will introduce the 
Python API on IOS XE for on-box network programmability.  With the Cisco Python CLI module packaged with Guest Shell,
you can access EXEC and configuration mode CLI commands programmatically.  Use cases include, but are not limited to 
device management and configuration, Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), and Embedded Event Manager (EEM) actions.  We 
will dig into the Cisco Python module with example hands-on exercises demonstrating real world use cases.
